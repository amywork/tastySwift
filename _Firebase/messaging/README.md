Introduction

Best Practices
--------------

- In this sample the request for permission to receive remote notifications
  is made on first run, this results in a permission dialog on first run.
  Most apps would want that dialog to be shown at a more appropriate time. So
  move the registration for remote notifications to a more appropriate place in
  your app.

Getting Started
---------------

- Add APNS certs to your project in **Project Settings** > **Notifications** in the [console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
- Run `pod install`
- Copy in the GoogleServices-Info.plist to your project
- Update the app Bundle ID in Xcode to match the Bundle ID of your APNs cert.
- Run the sample on your iOS device.

Note:
- You will need Swift 3.0 to run the Swift version of this quickstart.
- APS Environment Entitlements are required for remote notifications as of Xcode 8.
  Ensure that Push Notifications are on without error in App > Capabilities.
